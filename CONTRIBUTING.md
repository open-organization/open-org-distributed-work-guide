# Contributing
Ready to make a contribution? Great! Follow these steps:

1. **Determine what you'd like to contribute.** We're especially interested in experiences that help teams understand how embracing open principles can help them work better when they're distributed—and step-by-step exercises and best practices that help them put those principles into action. Review the [working table of contents](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide/blob/master/contents.md) to get a sense of what's in the works.
2. **Check out the editorial board to see what's in progress.** We maintain a [project board board](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide/projects/1) tracking writing-in-progress. Just make sure someone else isn't already working on what you'd like to contribute (if so, perhaps collaborate!).
3. **Open an issue.** Ready to pitch an idea? Just head over to our [running list of outstanding issues](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide/issues) and open your own. Tell us what you'd like to contribute, how it connects with the guide's themes, and why it's important for readers to understand.

And that's it! project editors and maintainers will connect with you to help you outline, develop, and write your work—whatever you need to make a superb contribution.
