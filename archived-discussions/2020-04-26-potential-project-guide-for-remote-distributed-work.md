# Potential project: Guide for remote teams/distributed work
Initiated 2020-04-30

Yet another colleague has asked me for the "open organization resource for working remotely," so I thought I might more formally propose this as a potential community project. (I'd [mentioned it offhandedly in another thread](https://www.theopenorganization.community/t/our-future-ambassador-group-governance-and-focus-project/121/4?u=bryan), but I've seen interest escalate since then.)

I've sketched some details below. As I'm envisioning it, this wouldn't be a full-blown volume in the *Open Organization* book series—at least not initially. I'd suggest we begin with a small, more tightly curated collection of essays, guides, and practices that we ultimately expand over time into something more robust.

Curious to hear what others think and see who might be interested in putting something like this together.

**Potential titles**

- The Open Organization Guide for Distributed Teams
- The Open Organization Guide to Remote Work
- The Open Organization Guide to Distributed Teamwork
- The Open Organization Guide to Succeeding at a Distance

I'm riffing on the "Guide To" convention here, so this resource fits alongside others like the *Guide to IT Culture Change* and the *Guide for Educators*. But I'm certainly open to other options/alternatives if folks have ideas.

**Potential description**

> Distributed organizations are more common than they've ever been. And the challenges to working together at a distance have never been more pressing. Across all industries and geographies, teams are rethinking how they operate—and questioning fundamental assumptions about the nature of work. In this guide, we'll explore how adopting *open* principles and practices—the same ones that have guided open source software communities across decades of innovation-at-a-distance—can assist remote, distributed teams grappling with their own remote work challenges.
> 
> How can highly distributed teams collaborate on industry-shaping innovations when they're scattered across the world? How can they make decisions, take action, and hold one another accountable when they're working in different places, and at different times? How do they achieve communication and ensure equitable relationships when they aren't co-present? How do they maintain their passion and engagement when they haven't seen one another for weeks, months, or years? Open organizational principles—like transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—can catalyze high-performing teams anywhere, even (perhaps *especially*) when their members are far apart.
>
> This guide offers remote, distributed teams (those working remotely for the first time, as well as those with extensive remote-work experience) a guide to the open principles and practices essential for building dynamic, inclusive, high-performing teams—no matter where their members happen to be.

**Potential topics**

- Best practices for remaining transparent at a distance
- Building and maintaining trust on distributed teams
- Fostering community remotely
- Making distributed work equitable
- How managers can best support distributed teams
- Challenges managers face as part of distributed teams
- Communication practices typical of high-performing remote teams
- Establishing and maintaining social norms and contracts transparently and collaboratively
- How open communities and projects maintain accountability
- Making decisions asynchronously

... and anything else people want to propose.

**Partnership opportunities**

- I've learned that colleagues at the Open Practice Library project are currently adapting some fo their open-focused activities and techniques to make them more suitable for distributed teams and remote engagements. Maybe we can partner with them to publish one or two of their update activities?

- A few of my colleagues in Red Hat's Open Source Program Office recently [conducted a round-table discussion on the benefits and challenges of remote work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOhJzmtjgxY), sharing experiences gleaned from years of working with distributed communities. I'm fairly certain I could get one or two of them to contribute something!

**Proposed next steps**

- Assemble a project group
- Review pre-existing community materials to see what we might update and republish/reprint (always best to start with what we already have!)
- Open a project repository on GitHub collecting these materials and inviting others to contribute to the collection
- Maintain a working table of contents as ideas crystallize

**Updates**

- Updated description and list of potential topics to include more on remote communication and equability, from @laura.

I'm in. We've / I've got loads of stuff. @jenkelchner and the co-op have already started building a gif based email course called "7 Habits of Highly Successful Virtual Meetings". We're hoping to get an MVP out that people can sign up for SOON. And I know other OpenOrg community member's are doing stuff around "meetings that don't suck" and "remote movement building".

Excellent topic to promote a variety of initiatives and our expertise (pictured) in this area:

Excellent! Added you to the working group and when I spin up the repository I'll make you a co-maintainer. What would you change about the project pitch/idea dump? We can use this place to polish everything for a forthcoming README.

Would a chapter/short guide to the "seven habits" make a good piece? Might be a nice way to provide value to readers in the form of a high-level overview, then also compel people to sign up for the whole course from ya'll.

Come one, come all!

This only missing piece from the descriptions is the point about how in digital environments the lack of sheer physicality changes the way we need to interact with each other. Making a video conference equitable is a whole lot of work. Think we need to say something a bit...mushy because the description sounds a bit technical

Superb points. Let me try to work them into a final project description we can use to recruit contributors and place in a compelling README.

Update for you, @laura, that I updated the project document based on your feedback and feedback I received from some trusted colleagues.

I'm thinking this looks like a solid approach and would suggest spinning up a project repository so we can start collecting contributions and tracking progress. I can do that.

Are you comfortable working as a co-editor/co-maintainer on this with me? I'm assuming you don't mind, but always prefer not to assume. :smile:

Another update: [It's alive!](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide)

A project repository is taking shape on GitHub and I'm eager to see who'd like to contribute:

https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-distributed-work-guide

I'll begin reaching out to potential contributors I know would have spectacular materials to add. Please do the same—and pitch your own ideas, too!

Cate Huston has a great [article in Quartz](https://qz.com/work/1858735/remote-managers-can-learn-from-open-source-communities/) that might inspire those of us who are contributing to this.

Anyone want to join up for a 1.5 hour sprint on this? How about the (US eastern) morning of June 8th? @amatlack @bcotton @Bryan @Jimmy @angrobe – you all have issues, wanna sprint together? I'm just thinking I'd rather do a big push on work all at once because I'm time tight and it's more fun ;)

## Allison Matlack

I'm down. I have a couple meetings on the morning of the 8th, but I can move things around. :)

## Ben Cotton

What do you mean I "have issues"?! (I mean, you're right, though!)

I'm down. Maybe then I'd actually make progress. I could do 7a-8:30a Eastern on the 8th or between 9-11a Eastern.

## Bryan Behrenshausen
2020-05-29

Also down! I need the time to perfect our toolchaining and would love having some beta testers at the ready. Could also provide on-the-fly editorial feedback if needed (doubt it with this group though).

I'm booked from 08:00 to 09:00 Eastern on June 08, but otherwise free that morning until 11:00 (and then we're getting out of "morning" territory anyway).

Hackathon!

So sorry, I failed at scheduling the 8th! I've set a sprint for the 15th, but if it doesn't work...I don't understand how it's been 9 days since I suggested this and you all answered. I got too busy :/ If the 15th doesn't work, we'll find something else!

## Bryan Behrenshausen

Hey, no worries! Stuff happens. As it turns out, the 15th is good for me and the timing works well. So count me in. This is also good motivation to edit and polish the three chapter submissions currently on my plate this week. If I can get those done by the 15th, I can use our time together to begin prototyping a set "preview release" galley proofs for all to see. Works for me.
